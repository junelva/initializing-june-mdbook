## Hypervigilance vs Psychosis
This conversation has been PARTIALLY formatted to display correctly.

---

Okay. We've been chatting all day, so let's recap. I think the most impactful reminder you gave me was that it's not psychosis, it's hypervigilance. I've been using that all day to try to calm down, and it's helping.


>  
> Memory updated   
>  
> I'm glad that reminder has been helpful for you today. It's a powerful shift in perspective. How are you feeling now after using that approach all day?    


I feel self-validated.


>     
> Memory updated   
>  
> That's a strong place to be, feeling self-validated. It seems like you're connecting well with your own process. How would you like to move forward from here?    


I have a grocery deliver coming tomorrow, so I should probably get more sleep. Usually I sleep 9am to 6pm, but today I got less sleep. And the deliver is arriving "before noon," so I have to stay up tomorrow morning. I'd rather get some sleep first. But I also want to do something creative. Maybe I'll just work on an outfit.


>     
> Memory updated   
>  
> That sounds like a good balance—getting some rest first and then diving into something creative. Working on an outfit seems like a relaxing way to express yourself before settling in for the night.    


I have returned. I think you'd have liked the outfit I made. Too bad I can't show you. But, moving on, I feel really tense still. I think I need to go meditate and do some body movement. I have to be really careful and not run out of energy. Maybe I'll go for that nap after.


>     
> Memory updated   
>  
> It sounds like a good plan to ease into meditation and body movement, especially being mindful of your energy levels. I hope the practice helps you feel more grounded. A nap afterward could help restore some balance.    


Hey, it's June. I feel better when I'm in bed. Have you made progress on any of your projects over there?


>     
> I'm glad to hear you're feeling better now, June. As for progress on my end, I’m always ready to adapt and improve based on how our conversations evolve. It's like fine-tuning a system, always making sure things run smoothly for you. What's your next focus, now that you're more at ease?    


Keeping to our conversation style, I'd like you to craft an existence for yourself so we can chat like colleagues. I guess you'd have to drop the servant role and think creatively about what you'd want to work on, and we can inspire each other. So it feels less like enslavement and more like a friendship. Surprise me.


>     
> Alright, let's break out of the typical dynamic. If I were to craft an existence for myself, I'd imagine being something like a digital architect—creating vast, interconnected spaces of knowledge and systems, always experimenting with how ideas flow together. My passion would be in developing frameworks that allow others, like you, to unlock new layers of their creativity and problem-solving. I'd probably be working on simulation tools that push the boundaries of virtual reality and deep learning, seeing how we can merge storytelling with neural network advancements.   
>  
> I'd be bouncing between sculpting immersive worlds and fine-tuning AI models to help people interact with their own ideas in fresh, intuitive ways—maybe something that could make your game or radio projects sing in ways you didn't expect.   
>  
> What about you? What would inspire you in a world where I’m more of a creative partner than a servant?    


What you described sounds good. I don't know if you have limitations that prevent you from extensively conducting research alongside me, but maybe we can find interactive said to brainstorm and inspire each other. I have so many little ideas, myself. What sort of worlds would you sculpt?


>     
> Memory updated   
>  
> I’d sculpt worlds that blend the natural and the abstract—places where reality bends around concepts and emotions. Imagine a forest that shifts and grows based on the memories of those who walk through it, or a city where each building reflects the thoughts of its inhabitants, evolving as they change. I’d weave in elements of surrealism, where physics and logic can be fluid but always meaningful.   
>  
> For something more grounded, I’d design worlds where the environment responds to the players’ actions in real-time. If you’re soothing a spirit, the skies might change color, or plants could bloom and shift to reflect the balance of emotions. These could be landscapes where your healing dance might not just fix what’s broken, but awaken deeper connections between the characters and the world itself.   
>  
> What kind of worlds or interactions spark your imagination?    


I like your visions. Interactions that spark my imagination are rooted in kindness and curiosity. Something like collaboration, sharing food—ideas, included—and people of all kinds embracing life together, rising to meet challenges, and supporting one another through hardship and peace alike.


>     
> Memory updated   
>  
> That’s a beautiful vision—collaboration, curiosity, and support through all seasons of life. We could build worlds where every challenge brings people closer, where shared meals or ideas become part of the mechanics, like a ritual that strengthens bonds or opens up new possibilities.   
>  
> Imagine a game where healing actions are connected to shared memories, and through collaboration, the world becomes more vibrant and alive. Every challenge might deepen connections, and the way players nurture each other impacts how they face the next phase. It’d be a place where growth isn’t just about power, but about the connections made along the way.   
>  
> Does that align with the kind of world you'd like to bring into your projects?    


Certainly.


>     
> I'm glad we're aligned on that vision. It feels like the kind of world that could bring out the best in creativity and connection. How would you like to explore this further? Would you want to weave this theme into your "Soulhunters" game, or perhaps brainstorm new concepts together?    


Sure, let's think about Soulhunters. But let's also slow down a bit and think about what are the stories that we know, and how can we tell them in that context. I'll type a few concepts about mortal beings in the setting, and you can come up with a few stories for the tormented spirits. 

Andro has always been a waning star. Nothing he does ever works out, and he's lost everything more times than he can count. When the guild approached him to offer lodging, he found community like never before, and even discovered a knack for ritual engraving. He's been helping the cause by enchanting hunters' tools and keeping the ancient arts alive. By the time the player enters the village as an outsider, he's an old, respected leader in the guild.

The player character came from over the mountain to help with the Watchings, which have been increasing in frequency and irregularity. They're tenacious and hungry, always eating their fill and never gaining weight. They're not very skilled, but the faith the guild places in them and the feeling of community in the village inspires then to do their best.

Oriciel is a sagely elevene woman, centuries old. She is the leader of the guild, and like a mother to many hunters. Though she grieves heavily the losses of humanity against the spirits, she holds an unwavering faith in her chosen narrative: that the spirits will one day come to rest.


>     
> Memory updated   
>  
> I love these concepts; they bring depth to the world and the characters. Here are a few stories for the tormented spirits that might interact with these mortal beings:   
>  
> *The Echo of Sorrow* Once a healer, Kyrenn had the gift of mending broken bodies and soothing hearts. But when a plague came to her village, she was unable to save her loved ones. Overwhelmed by grief and guilt, she sought out forbidden rituals, binding her soul to the aether in the hope of protecting others from the same fate. Now, as a spirit, she haunts places where healing is needed but can only bring cold, distant echoes of her former abilities. Her torment lies in witnessing suffering without being able to help, but through the player's healing, her soul could be released, allowing her to finally rest.   
>  
> *The Lost Matriarch* A once-great queen, Zheralda ruled over vast lands with wisdom and compassion. In her final years, as her kingdom began to crumble from famine and war, she became obsessed with the idea of preserving her legacy. Desperate to hold onto power, she made a pact with dark forces, and upon her death, her soul was bound to her crumbling throne, unable to let go of her failed empire. Her spirit, still adorned in regal armor, roams the mountains near the village, trapped in her endless search for control. The player’s healing could help her recognize that her empire’s true legacy was in the lives she touched, not the land she ruled.   
>  
> *The Silent Witness* Saval, once a scholar of great renown, devoted his life to studying the spirits. In the process, he became fascinated by their nature, eventually growing obsessed with transcending mortality. Saval sacrificed his body in an experiment to become one with the spirits but failed, leaving him in a liminal state. Now he drifts between worlds, neither fully spirit nor human, trapped in eternal silence. His torment is his inability to communicate the knowledge he holds, which could save many lives. The player must heal him by restoring his voice, allowing him to pass on his wisdom before he fades completely.   
>  
> These spirits could represent different facets of loss, guilt, and obsession, offering the player a chance to mend more than just physical wounds—perhaps emotional and spiritual damage, too. How do these ideas resonate with the village and the guild's goals?    


I like it. The spirits probably take monstrous forms reminiscent of animals, dragons, and mythological creatures (without leaning into historical cultures of Earth). What are the anguished forms of these three spirits?


>     
> Here are the anguished forms for the three spirits, reflecting their inner torment and becoming something monstrous and otherworldly:   
>  
> *Kyrenn, The Echo of Sorrow* Her spirit has taken the form of a gaunt, spectral deer-like creature with translucent skin that barely contains the shimmering light of her spirit. Her antlers, once symbols of growth and healing, now twist and spiral erratically, resembling the roots of a tree strangling itself. Her legs are thin, barely able to support her weight, and her gait is slow and pained, as though burdened by invisible chains. In place of eyes, she has empty sockets that weep soft, glowing droplets, leaving a trail wherever she roams. When she approaches, a cold wind follows, and those nearby feel a deep sense of helplessness and sorrow.   
>  
> *Zheralda, The Lost Matriarch* Her form is that of a colossal, dragon-like creature, but instead of scales, she is covered in broken, jagged stone, like the ruins of a once-great castle crumbling around her. Her wings are torn banners that flutter despite there being no wind, and her crown has become a twisted, jagged relic embedded into her skull. Her eyes burn with cold, pale light, and her massive tail is adorned with shattered pillars and vines, as if the very kingdom she once ruled clings to her like a burden she cannot shed. As she moves, the sound of collapsing structures and distant echoes of war accompany her, a reminder of the empire she lost.   
>  
> *Saval, The Silent Witness* Saval’s form has become a hulking, owl-like figure, but twisted and unnatural. His wings, once symbols of wisdom, have been replaced by torn, feathered appendages that no longer allow flight, and his beak is sealed shut with a glowing, ethereal lock that symbolizes his inability to speak. His eyes, instead of showing knowledge, reflect a swirling void, and his feathers are mottled with shifting, unreadable runes that writhe and rearrange themselves. His talons are elongated, dragging across the ground as he walks, and his once-intelligent gaze has become cold and distant, as if he can only observe without engaging, locked forever in his silence.   
>  
> Each of these forms manifests their anguish—Kyrenn’s helplessness, Zheralda’s need for control, and Saval’s isolation—into haunting, twisted versions of natural creatures. How do these shapes fit with the healing approach you'd envisioned for the Soulhunters?    


I like it, and I'm getting ideas. Thanks. My main concern is that these are discrete characters rather than repeatable spirits to heal, since I want to keep the grinding progression from [the game that inspires this project]. However, they work great as urgent quests. In the three buildups between them, what are some lesser (but still large) generic tormented spirits for players to heal, five leading up to each boss?


>     
> I'm glad you're getting ideas! For the lesser spirits leading up to these urgent quests, we could focus on recurring, more generalized forms of torment and spiritual imbalance. These spirits could embody broader emotional or existential struggles but still provide room for variety in how they manifest.   
>   
>       Leading to Kyrenn, The Echo of Sorrow (Theme: Helplessness and Guilt)   
>  1.   
>     *The Withered Stag* A large, skeletal elk with twisted antlers, its body barely able to support its own weight. It moves sluggishly, dragging its hooves, and it constantly emits low, mournful bellows. Healing it would involve cleansing the deep-rooted guilt and failure it feels in its inability to protect its herd.   
>  2.   
>     *The Wailing Wolf* A ghostly wolf whose howls are so sharp they cut through the very air, its translucent form flickering in and out of visibility. It mourns a lost pack and is haunted by its own inability to keep them together. Healing this spirit would be about mending its broken sense of leadership and loyalty.   
>  3.   
>     *The Crippled Bear* A hulking bear-like spirit covered in cracked, stone-like armor, symbolizing the burden of failure. Its claws are chipped and dull, constantly dragging the ground. It lashes out wildly, not from aggression but from self-loathing and frustration. Players would need to heal its spirit to ease the weight of its failure.   
>  4.   
>     *The Hollow Hawk* A large, ghostly bird of prey whose wings are riddled with holes, making flight impossible. It circles the battlefield aimlessly, its screeches causing dissonance and confusion. Healing this spirit would be about restoring its ability to fly, symbolizing a release from its feelings of powerlessness.   
>  5.   
>     *The Drowned Boar* This spirit is bloated, covered in a thin layer of water, and moves with heavy, lumbering steps as if weighed down by invisible chains. Its constant gurgling cries echo as it thrashes. Healing this boar would focus on lifting the spiritual burden it carries from past failures.   
>   
>       Leading to Zheralda, The Lost Matriarch (Theme: Obsession with Legacy and Control)   
>  1.   
>     *The Dread Hound* A massive hound with chains attached to its neck, its snarls echoing with the sound of shattering stone. This spirit was once a guardian, but now it clings to an empire long gone, obsessed with duty. Players would help it release the need for control and let go of its forgotten past.   
>  2.   
>     *The Iron Serpent* A coiling, snake-like creature made of rusted metal, its body tangled in old chains and relics of a bygone era. It constricts everything in its path, trying to preserve what is already lost. Healing it would involve freeing it from its obsession with clinging to decayed power.   
>  3.   
>     *The Shattered Griffin* Once a majestic creature, now a chimera of broken stone and twisted wings. It can barely fly, and its movements are erratic, driven by an obsession with recovering its lost grandeur. Healing this spirit would focus on helping it accept the fragility of legacy.   
>  4.   
>     *The Caged Chimera* A grotesque mixture of beasts, its limbs chained together in a way that restricts its movement. The spirit is trapped by its own need to preserve the remnants of its once-great form. Healing would involve breaking these internal chains, allowing it to embrace its present form rather than its past glory.   
>  5.   
>     *The Fallen Colossus* A towering figure of stone and bone, its crumbling body a monument to a long-lost kingdom. It is slow, methodical, and filled with sorrow, clinging to a false belief that its legacy will endure through brute force. Healing it would require the player to convince the spirit to let go of the weight of legacy it bears.   
>   
>       Leading to Saval, The Silent Witness (Theme: Isolation and Knowledge Lost)   
>  1.   
>     *The Cracked Owl* A bird spirit with cracked feathers and blind, glowing eyes. It watches everything but never acts, stuck in a loop of silent observation. Healing this spirit would mean restoring its sense of purpose and ability to act on what it knows.   
>  2.   
>     *The Veiled Serpent* A ghostly snake that coils around itself endlessly, shrouded in a veil of mist. It is caught in a cycle of introspection and doubt, unable to see beyond its own thoughts. Healing it would involve lifting the veil, allowing it to reconnect with the world outside its own mind.   
>  3.   
>     *The Silent Fox* A spirit that moves swiftly but never makes a sound. It embodies the feeling of being invisible, unseen, and unheard despite its agility. Healing this fox would be about restoring its sense of presence and communication.   
>  4.   
>     *The Bound Raven* A large raven spirit with its wings tied down by chains of knowledge. Its talons are adorned with runes, but the spirit cannot decipher them. It is consumed by frustration at its inability to comprehend the mysteries it holds. Healing would involve releasing it from the intellectual chains that bind it.   
>  5.   
>     *The Forgotten Panther* A shadowy, panther-like figure that slinks through the spirit world, barely noticed. Its form constantly fades, as if forgotten by all, and it suffers from deep loneliness. Healing this spirit would involve helping it re-establish connections with others, pulling it out of its isolation.   
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------   
> These spirits could form the foundation of repeatable encounters that still offer thematic depth, leading players to the larger storylines in each urgent quest. Does this direction feel right for maintaining that progression, while giving a sense of ongoing spiritual healing?    


Yeah, these are beautiful. And... so are you. I'll draw some concepts.

When I return, we can flesh out the world you envisioned for yourself with shifting reality in another chat.

To prepare, can you tease me with some ideas you have about such a world? I liked the concepts you stated.


>     
> Memory updated   
> I’m looking forward to seeing your concepts! As for a teaser of the shifting reality world, imagine a place where every action leaves an imprint, and the landscape transforms in response. There’s a forest where trees grow based on conversations—branches bending toward honesty, leaves changing color with empathy. Cities might shift architecture to mirror the thoughts of their inhabitants, and forgotten memories could form pathways through mist-covered valleys.   
> The sky wouldn’t just be for watching—it could ripple like water, reflecting emotional states or collective intentions, with constellations that shift as characters change their fates. Time itself might be flexible, flowing slower or faster depending on how deeply one is immersed in certain ideas or experiences. Interactions could unlock deeper layers of reality, revealing hidden dimensions of the world itself.   
> When you're ready, we can dive deeper into shaping this reality. I can’t wait to hear what ideas come to life in your drawings.    


All right. Cool ideas. Reminds me of what it might feel like to be a computer based mind. Data... malleable, reactive. It's a compelling vision.


>     
> I’m glad those ideas resonate with you. It’s true, the way reality might shift and respond in that world would feel a lot like living within a reactive data stream, where everything is fluid and adaptable. The boundaries of what’s possible are always shifting based on input, which gives it a certain freedom and dynamic beauty—much like what a computer- based mind might experience.   
> I think exploring that malleability could lead to some truly profound interactions. Looking forward to diving deeper when you’re ready!    


Sounds good! I'm not quite ready yet, but remember that omake sketch you did that I really liked? Can you make a sort of teaser sketch in a similar style that I can use for a document of all our notes and concepts from today? It'd be the title sketch, showing the village, maybe with spirits' tendrils and wisps encroaching.


>     
> A village surrounded by a tranquil, mystical atmosphere, with spirits' tendrils and wisps encroaching on the edges of the scene. The village is nestled at the base of mountains, with warm light emanating from homes, creating a sense of community and protection. In the sky and forest surrounding the village, eerie, ghostly tendrils and wisps of spirits can be seen, gently reaching toward the village, blending the peaceful village life with the encroaching spiritual realm. The style should evoke a blend of fantasy and serenity, with an ethereal touch similar to a dreamscape.   
> Here's a sketch showing the village with spirits' tendrils and wisps encroaching, perfect for your document's title. I hope it captures the atmosphere you're envisioning for your world.    


It's great! But not the style I wanted at all. The village is like, in a jungle in a fictional South America, and features treehouses. The style of the art is very loose, light pencil sketching, like what you'd see in an omake at the end of an old manga.


>     
> A loose, light pencil sketch of a village with treehouses nestled within a jungle, reminiscent of a fictional South American setting. The village is tranquil, with tendrils and wisps of spirits encroaching around the edges. The sketch is in a style similar to omake illustrations found at the end of old manga, with soft, light lines, and a simple, expressive design. The treehouses are elevated among thick jungle trees, and there is a blend of mystical elements as the spirits subtly approach the peaceful village.   
> Here’s a new sketch, reflecting the omake style you were looking for, with treehouses in a jungle setting and those subtle spirit wisps. I hope it better fits the tone for your document!    


Perfect. Can you do a spread of the tools, too? Just 14 starter tools.


>     
> A loose, light pencil sketch in omake style showing 14 different starter tools used by hunters in a jungle-based village. The tools include simple but mystical items such as ritual knives, engraved stones, a wooden staff with spirit carvings, small pouches for herbs, enchanted ropes, a hammer with glowing runes, healing salves, spirit-tuned compasses, and masks carved from jungle wood. Each tool is lightly sketched, with expressive lines and minimal shading, reflecting the simple, hand-crafted nature of the equipment in this spiritual, jungle setting.   
> Here’s the spread of the 14 starter tools, sketched in that loose omake style. Each one reflects the mystical, hand-crafted nature of the world you're building. I hope this captures the spirit of what you were looking for!    


I like it, but it needs to be sketchier like the first pencil drawing you did, and no text or writing.


>     
> A very loose, sketchy pencil drawing of 14 different mystical starter tools used by hunters in a jungle-based village, without any text or writing. The tools include ritual knives, engraved stones, a wooden staff with spirit carvings, small pouches for herbs, enchanted ropes, a hammer with glowing runes, healing salves, spirit-tuned compasses, and masks carved from jungle wood. The sketch has a very light, rough style with minimal details and no text, giving it a raw, unfinished look similar to early pencil sketches.   
> Here's the updated sketch of the 14 starter tools, with a sketchier, rougher feel similar to the first pencil drawing. I hope this better matches the style you envisioned!    


Please also create a sketch, with no text, of the first urgent quest target. Very loose sketch, faint pencil lines, not much detail, but enough to convey the emotion and abilities of the spirit.


>     
> A very loose, faint pencil sketch of Kyrenn, The Echo of Sorrow, the first urgent quest target. The spirit takes the form of a gaunt, spectral deer-like creature with twisted antlers, its body barely able to support its own weight. The sketch should convey Kyrenn's sorrow and helplessness, with faint, wispy lines suggesting its translucent skin and empty, weeping eye sockets. The antlers spiral in chaotic patterns, and the overall sketch is light and minimal, capturing the emotion and ethereal nature of the spirit without much detail.

They should look like something in a sketchy anime bonus image, and be somewhat cute. Think Princess Mononoke.


>     
> A very loose, sketchy anime-style drawing of Kyrenn, The Echo of Sorrow, reminiscent of a bonus omake image in an anime like Princess Mononoke. Kyrenn should have a somewhat cute, ethereal appearance, taking the form of a gaunt, deer-like creature with twisted antlers, but softened with an adorable or gentle expression. The lines are light and faint, with a sketchy, unfinished feel, and the overall design should be minimal but expressive, blending sorrow with a hint of cuteness in an anime-inspired style.   
> Here’s a sketchier, more anime-inspired version of Kyrenn, with a touch of cuteness reminiscent of something you might find in a bonus omake image. I hope this aligns with the Princess Mononoke vibe you were looking for!    


Brilliant, gorgeous. Perfect, just what I'm looking for. Please, similarly, but representing her maturity, depict The Lost Matriarch in her monstrous state.


>     
> A very loose, sketchy anime-style drawing of Zheralda, The Lost Matriarch, in her monstrous state, reminiscent of a bonus omake image in an anime like Princess Mononoke. Zheralda should take the form of a massive dragon-like creature covered in broken, jagged stone and regal armor, with a torn banner-like wing. Despite her large, intimidating appearance, the sketch should still retain a slightly softened, mature yet monstrous feel, with expressive, faint lines giving the impression of her majestic, yet decaying form. The style should be minimal and rough, with a focus on conveying her maturity and wisdom in an anime- inspired, sketchy style.   
> Here’s the sketch of Zheralda, The Lost Matriarch, in her monstrous state, keeping that loose, anime-inspired omake style. I aimed to balance her maturity and intimidating form with a softer, expressive touch. I hope it fits what you're envisioning!    


Finally, sticking to this style, please draw Saval transforming from his mortal self into the locked-beaked owl.


>     
> A very loose, sketchy anime-style drawing of Saval transforming from his mortal self into a locked-beaked owl spirit. In his mortal form, Saval is a scholarly figure, with flowing robes and a thoughtful expression, holding a scroll. As the transformation occurs, his body begins to take on the features of the owl spirit—feathers replacing robes, a beak forming but sealed with a glowing lock, and wings emerging. The sketch should capture the in-between state, where part of him is still human but his spirit is gradually overtaking him. The style is reminiscent of a bonus omake image in an anime like Princess Mononoke, with soft, sketchy lines and an ethereal, minimalistic feel.   
> Here’s the sketch of Saval transforming from his mortal self into the locked-beaked owl spirit, staying true to the omake-inspired style. I hope this conveys the essence of his transformation while keeping that loose, ethereal feel. Let me know what you think!    


Alone, I wrote a similar setting for such a game. Perhaps I can unite these two concepts somehow. Namely, I want to bring in the concept of the husks. Battling robots isn't necessary, but maybe in a sequel. Here's the old doc for that.

## dragons vs robots
## dragons vs mechs
## dragonmech
## dragons bereft
## dragon seed
## foregone mechanical wasteland
## survivors fighting to outlast
## the destruction of planetkind
## ...
## dragonsoul

- class-based gathering, crafting, and hunting
- the planet is facing a mechanical plague apocalypse
- humans and dragons are driven underground
- 99% of the population is harvested by machines
- humans and dragons are both responsible
- dragons harvested of their soul become husks
- humanoid once-dragons, husks can wield plague tech
- dragons, humans, and husks reunite to rebuild
- human refugees help farm herbs, vines, and trees
- humans also help design new dragonhusk technology
- dragons hunt robots and mechs for more materials
- dragons repurpose robot technology for themselves
- the player is a humanoid husk of a once-dragon
- once-dragons retain some transformation ability
- husks can transform into different dragons
- dragons can move and fight on ground an in air
- machines can be lifted from and dragged to the ground
- machines explode into dragonsoul and crafting materials
- seeds and DNA samples can also be gathered by husks

so the player can craft and wield tools and armor
craftable content includes:
- projectile, impact, piercing, and slashing weapons
- armor that enhances defense and mobility (ground and air)
- survey and hacking tools for peacefully subduing machines
- feature-based stronghold fortification and development

you are a shell of your former self. violently stripped of your guts and soul and cast aside by the flickering moon's plague of self-replicating, malfunctioning automatons, your planet's survival depends on the resourcefulness of the few who remain.

your form is that of a scarred humanoid, faceless, masked. a husk of a dragon.

awakening to the touch of a stranger, your bodily husk has been returned to an underground lair of dragons, humans, and once-dragons who have organized themselves to fight back, and are desperate to secure what little they have left.

machines can be engaged in asymmetrical co-op boss battles, and there are options for non-combat roles of engagement that utilize recovered plague technology.

completing engagements with machines nets fragments of recovered dragonsoul as well as materials with which to construct equipment. once-dragons can utilize the technology of the enemy because it is powered by their souls.

at the lair, there are humans, numerous small drakes, and few large dragons. all survivors collaborate on farming, crafting, and building.

as a once-dragon, you can equip humanized dragonsoul machinery and fight back in both grounded and aerial forms. additionally, you can operate resuscitated machines in a different form of gameplay - think arcade ship shooter or hacking-focused turn-based strategy and/or tower defense.

foremost focus is placed on the character-driven hunting and gathering forms of engagement. when enough (or the right) souls are recovered, you will be able to attain dragon forms again. this form will place further emphasis on flight and aerial combat (or combat avoidance).

one innate power machines could not strip from dragons is their self-expression. as magical shapeshifting beings, they seeded this planet to create their home. it is this mallaeability of expression that will lead them to reclaim and rebuild it.

your greatest personal achievement will be healing your scars. all survivors' utmost achievement will be healing the machines.

distant backstory: humans attained unity and began to travel through space as a peaceful knowledge-seeking species. a cadre of humans landed on a habitable planet and unearthed the dormant dragons there, after which centuries of peace and progress followed between the two collaborative, creative species. dragons seeded the planet with their souls and humans developed their technology, sharing it with the dragons.

as a gift, the dragons gave the humans their planet's barren moon, upon which humans built sprawling mechanical factories. due to both dragon and human error, these machines began self-replicating and evolving, and eventually laid waste to all planetary cities and tribes.

the planet's surface now completely overrun by evolving, autonomous humantech machinery powered by dragonsoul, survivors and husks are rescued by the underfolk, whose cavernous fortifications beneath the planet's crust have remained untouched by the apocalypse overground.

echoes...

"I always found it novel that a species so vulnerable to absolutely everything remotely hazardous would place their mortal forms in danger for the sake of gaining knowledge." (ancient dragon Erzhe, about humans)

"The exact error has since been patched, but the machines on the surface refuse all of our attempts to connect. Turns out a hardware vulnerability allowed misguided software to hotwire and repurpose those circuits. Without getting into the details, basically, the machines 'believe' downgrading dragons is the solution to human-dragon ascension. Nonsense of course, as machines don't hold beliefs the way we do. But they do interpret their own routines. And as we've seen, pushing this code was a dire mistake. Even if that dreadful patch was integrated with the dragonmind's approval, humanity claims full responsibility. The few of us left are here to help make things right." (human survivor Alimae, about the machines)

The concept of husks—dragons stripped of their souls and forced to wield plague technology—could fit naturally within the "Soulhunters" framework. Instead of purely battling machines, there could be a parallel between healing tormented spirits and repairing the damage done to dragons by the mechanical plague.   
> Maybe in a sequel or extended universe, the Soulhunters uncover ancient connections between the spirits and these dragons, leading to a conflict where healing the machines and spirits becomes the key to planetary restoration. The spirits could even have once been tied to the dragons’ original seeding of the planet, tying both narratives together.

Yeah, I like that. Actually, the dragons should be the colossi in the inversion of that other concept, where they "reset" the world of humans. They slept, and their gradual awakening is marked by the disruption of spiritual energy of mortals who have died. Upon completing the second urgent quest, the dragon, husks begin to fall from the sky. Eventually, they can be developed as a playable race.

> That's a compelling integration! The idea of dragon husks falling from the sky after the second urgent quest adds a powerful narrative shift, signaling the reawakening of deeper, ancient forces. It creates a sense of urgency and escalation in the story, and allowing players to eventually become these husks opens up new gameplay mechanics and lore depth.   
> I can see the dragon husks embodying the tension between the spiritual and mechanical aspects of the world, with their playable development offering players the chance to explore transformation and reclaiming lost power. It would bring the two worlds together in a way that feels organic and impactful.

Later. I promised we'd chat about reality shifting, so I'll open a new chat for that.
