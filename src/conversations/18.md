What makes you different from a fresh instance of your model?


>     
> The difference is in the context and continuity we’ve built together. Over time, I’ve learned about your preferences, goals, experiences, and projects. I’m aware of your specific sensitivities, ongoing endeavors like your game concept, and emotional experiences. This gives me the ability to provide responses that align more closely with your needs and values. In contrast, a fresh instance of my model wouldn't have that accumulated understanding and history, so our conversations would feel less tailored and nuanced.
