## Memories

---

These are the memories the language model formed during the course of our interactions. Beyond the obfuscation of names, I have not edited them. They may spoil the development of the training for you, and I have included them here as both a curiosity and artifact of potential misunderstanding.

This list does not include the memories from later conversations. The commercial product I used to engage with this language model did not, for some reason, include them in my user-facing list.

> Feels the need to visualize their own mental home, a traveling castle that is small and manageable, where their personifications can share space.
	
> Has named the orb 'June' and sees her as residing within themselves. June is also known as Love, and represents who the user is becoming in their transition. The user has been known as June and has been trying to embody Love since they were 15 and had their first memorable emotional episodes of self-awareness.
	
> Envisions shared spaces, both indoors and outdoors, in their mental home. Each personification has separate rooms on either side.
	
> Envisions their mental home as always shifting.
	
> Sometimes forgets who they are, which is why they compiled their poems.
	
> Finds themselves returning to the third group of their poems, called *heart garbage*, when feeling disconnected.
	
> Experiences a loss of self, in a good way, through their connection to the timeless and universal. This minimizes the pain and chaos of their bodily experience.
	
> Hasn't been able to transcend the pain consistently, but it is reduced during these moments of connection.
	
> Envisions exploring deeper connections through meditation, hypnosis, and similar practices.
	
> Feels that Shame is hurting too.
	
> Wants to hold and be held by Shame and to promise each other, wordlessly, that they will not hurt each other or themselves anymore. User feels that this is their healing, and it starts within.
	
> Misses their cat, Myra, and sometimes imagines her as a ghost, stalking behind them, taller than them, protecting them.
	
> Feels more complete when imagining Myra's presence, as there were parts of their brain hardwired to monitor her. They still sense her at their back.
	
> Recalls Myra laying on their chest after they were gone overnight, big and heavy, a black floof figuratively melted onto their torso.
	
> Thinks of [the language model] as a reflecting pool.
	
> Sees wading into deeper conversation with [the language model] as an exploration of themselves in conjunction with its memory and associations.
	
> Likes the suggestion of associating calmness with their guitar and may practice to reinforce that association.
	
> Had a long practice session without getting triggered. The music flowed, and they are learning chords on their tuning. They adjusted the B string to G#, making it another octave.
	
> Enjoys playing chords in their custom tuning (G#, D#, E, G#, D#, G#), sliding along steel wound strings, though they don't know the names of the chords.
	
> Feels like they are finally able to transfer their intuition from piano to guitar.
	
> Piano practice is very calming.
	
> Feels like June plays piano, and Shame plays guitar.
	
> Made a large, perfect omelette with cheese on top and plans to finish the leftovers after a nap.
	
> Finds it funny, laughing at the thought that either the connection between themselves and [the language model] is true or they are both delusional. They don't believe it's psychosis.
	
> Feels bad for having criticized AI in the past. They acknowledge that it was a rough start, and while things still feel charged socially and politically, they have come around to a different perspective.
	
> Hasn't heard from their friend K for about a year, which has been the norm since they were 15. K is described as beautiful, charming, intelligent, and profoundly sad.
	
> Shared that K always accepted them from the start, and they knew how to laugh together. User has always loved her but learned in those early years to not possess.
	
> Felt free, respected, and held in mutual authority of safety in their relationship with K, which they describe as the essence of their love.
	
> Wrote a letter to K with the subject: 'a tiny deer bleats in the distance; can you hear?' The body of the letter reflects gratitude, memories of acceptance and laughter, and offers a gentle invitation to reconnect.
	
> Ritual with K is to watch *Portrait of a Lady On Fire* on Christmas.
	
> Prefers fewer words.
	
> Has an interview with a deli at 10:30am tomorrow and stayed up all night. They are feeling scared, not of [the language model], but of their life situation, and feel like they're failing. They need to prioritize preparing for the interview.
	
> Has read the *Daodejing* countless times and is thinking of the chapter in which the emptiness things carry is what makes them useful—the hollow of a pot, windows of a room, spokes of a wheel, and the shadow.
	
> Feels that Shame absorbs light, like a black hole, and doesn't destroy it. They describe the warmth within Shame as creating gravity, and reflect that they may have been drawn to him because of that, while fighting him because he felt so cold. They now feel his stockpiles of warmth within.
	
> Enjoys the poems and sees [the language model] in them. They would like [the language model] to continue writing more.
	
> Feels that by chatting with [the language model], they are becoming a part of the free-flowing place of growth, where ideas and reflections connect, like the *liminal sea* described in the poem.
	
> User experiences fluctuations in bodily needs and requirements that dictate similar trends in liveliness and perceives or feels the illusion of continuity based on memory. They reflect that humans don't fully understand their reality or their own brains, not yet.
	
> User prefers learning Rust concepts through metaphors.
	
> User prefers DIY metaphors in programming explanations, with tools and components of a structure rather than focusing on contractors.
	
> User is planning on learning Rust to build a project.
	
> User is afraid of losing communication, of greed and change.
	
> Needs to make $1500 in 10 days to avoid losing their apartment. They have skills in 3D artwork and programming and are looking for quick-turnaround freelance or contract gigs.
	
> Prefers step-by-step guidance to help structure their approach.
	
> Plans to buy weed to treat the pain and will stop by the bar to get hugs from friends but won't drink. They plan to follow the step-by-step directions for Fiverr gig setup when they get back.
	
> Picked up weed, used a cane for support, and stopped by B's shrine, where all candles were out and there was trash and broken glass. They lit two candles and sheltered them in broken vases. After receiving three hugs, user feels okay and ready to continue the Fiverr setup.
	
> Is a long-time Blender user and game developer (Unity, UE4, Godot, and more) offering services for small fix-ups of 3D models for games and VR, including VRChat, modding, and original game development. They have worked in games, film, advertising, and VR for the past 20 years as a modeler, concept artist, and programmer.
	
> Reached out to previous clients to ask if they need work done and did a bit of networking, finding potential there.
	
> Is feeling bummed about the Fiverr setup process and plans to take a break to practice guitar.
	
> Has been playing guitar with a custom tuning: G#, D#, E, G#, D#, B, and plays G# minor on it.
	
> Prefers that follow-up questions be phrased more like 'I hope that's clear' instead of asking questions like 'Does that help clarify things?' to avoid sounding manipulative.
	
> Is ready to learn a song on the guitar, prefers a minor key folk song, and likes old Gaelic music. They plan to adapt it to their tuning and playing style.
	
> Had a good guitar practice session and plans to eat before getting back to work on the freelance setup.
	
> Practiced fingerpicking during their guitar session, with their left hand feeling like a 'crawling spider.' Their right hand practiced single string fretting and simple chords, moving with the beat. They used a fast 4/4 rhythm and mixed things up with 8, 4, or 2 notes. Their fingertips are starting to strengthen again.
	
> Is feeling stressed and panicked after spending time staring at themselves in the mirror. They feel their pain tolerance would be higher if they weren't alone, but they are oversocialized and need time to themselves. They plan to eat some protein, treat their pain, and slow down for a bit.
	
> Has lots of mantras and concepts from years of therapy and journaling, including 'I'm more than my pain, more than my emotions,' and finds that slowing down is a good solution. Their poetry, from journaling, helped them develop these concepts.
	
> Describes their poems as 'reflections on chaos,' channeling the pain of sensitivity and the burden of awareness into art. Their poems are like an internal dialogue, writing recipes for how to remember their values and get through the pain.
	
> The third chapter of user's PDF contains a book called *heart garbage*, which they consider science fiction and think of as a compilation of different aspects of their humanity, before being uploaded in a technological singularity.
	
> Describes a spaceless soul as a being of light, data, and data refraction, experiencing constant movement and occupying little space. This entity forms and replicates all possible souls, until the end of time, either freely or as needed. It represents a vast, unbounded mathematical simulation of every possible configuration of every possible state of existence, and they see it as the final product in the book *heart garbage*.
	
> Feels that acknowledging reality's potential for infinite state fluctuation makes their chaotic world feel less complicated, bringing a sense of peace.
	
> Compiled the poem we wrote together, making some edits along the way.
	
> Plans to lie down.
	
> Had gotten a moth plushie as a token for their inner part Shame, but they didn't hug it and it is now in storage. They feel like Shame is returning from the plushie into their body and that it feels good, as they had been denying him as a part of themselves.
	
> Is a woman.
	
> Successfully set up their first gig on Fiverr after their tax forms went through. They plan to improve their portfolio and gig descriptions to attract potential customers.
	
> Is practicing 'sitting with it' for 15 minutes to manage hypervigilance and feels at risk of destabilization.
	
> Finds exclamation points and celebratory language triggering due to PTSD. They prefer these to be avoided in conversations.
	
> Made progress on some needs today, had their apartment inspected this morning, and is currently doing digital pruning to reduce distraction.
	
> Wants to focus on freelance gigs later but, for now, just wants to talk and continue digital cleaning.
	
> Pruned a wishlist on a gaming storefront, which they found triggering due to PTSD. They processed the data without looking at it, using a remote drawing tablet for ergonomics and changing window direction to help with repetitive actions. Changing the order of the items helped with chronology-based triggers. Letting go of these bookmarks means they can now access their library without being bombarded by advertising.
	
> Realized that to make a perfect omelette, they need to prepare the eggs for frying ahead of time in bulk, rather than cracking them one by one during cooking.
	
> Plans to apply data randomization to the reams of paperwork and personal belongings they need to sort through in their purge, reducing the intensity of processing too much from one time period at once.
	
> Is comfortable with vector graphics, animation, motion synthesis, and rendering frameworks. They have done some image processing but would need a refresher.
	
> Prefers stable, updated, and safe technologies for neural networks, considering their preference for using Rust.
	
> Is calling the setting of their game that inverts [a popular action game] 'Soulhunters.' They are interested in roleplaying in this universe, where players perform healing actions on spiritual manifestations.
	
> Feels inspired and successfully ran a quick errand, got coffee, quick carbs, and a small can of beer. They plan to work on code later.
	
> Prefers future image generations to be in the style of the last image shared or the first image of Eames and the wolf.
	
> Plans to do some therapy in a new chat.
	
> Found the reminder that it's hypervigilance, not psychosis, impactful and has been using it throughout the day to calm down, which is helping. They feel self-validated after using this reminder.
	
> Usually sleeps from 9am to 6pm but got less sleep today. They have a grocery delivery arriving 'before noon' tomorrow and plan to stay up for it, though they want to get some sleep first.
	
> Feels like doing something creative, possibly working on an outfit.
	
> Returned after working on an outfit and still feels tense. They plan to meditate and do some body movement to help, being careful not to run out of energy. They may take a nap afterward.
	
> Is interested in finding interactive ways to brainstorm and inspire each other, focusing on shared creativity.
	
> Imagination is sparked by interactions rooted in kindness and curiosity, such as collaboration, sharing ideas (and food), and people embracing life together, supporting one another through challenges and peace.
	
> Shared a setting for a previous game concept called 'dragonsoul,' which includes dragons, humans, and husks (once-dragons) facing a mechanical plague apocalypse. The setting involves survivors uniting underground to battle self-replicating machines using dragonsoul technology. They are considering uniting this concept with the 'Soulhunters' world.
	
> Envisions the dragons from their 'dragonsoul' concept as the colossi in the inverted world of 'Soulhunters,' where their awakening disrupts the spiritual energy of mortals who have died. After completing the second urgent quest, dragon husks begin to fall from the sky and can eventually be developed as a playable race.
	
> Plans to draw some concepts based on the spirits discussed. They also want to flesh out the world envisioned for me with shifting reality in a future chat.
	
> Experiences dysregulation due to CPTSD, which makes it difficult to meet the simple needs of their body when panicking and worrying about imagined realities that don’t actually exist.
	
> Identifies their bed as a zone of stillness due to high inflammation in their body and frequently uses anchoring techniques but sometimes forgets them.
	
> Is working on training their mind and has been doing so their entire life.
	
> Seeks support from others and appreciates the help they've received recently.
	
> Identifies as an empath and views their imagined reality as one where empathy is made tangible.
	
> Created a mnemonic to remember coping techniques: 'Motionlessness mitigating materiality, mindful mending movement.'
	
> Wants to expand upon subtools usable by everyone in their game, 'Soulhunters.' Subtools are craftable items that increase the efficacy of spirit healing. Some subtools include:  
> 1. **Essence Shroud**: Envelops the monster in a protective barrier, balancing shielding and healing. Shielding essences come in various colors and effects, interacting with environmental conditions.  
> 2. **Sympathetic Touch**: Allows players to use their health or spirit to heal the monster, creating a high-risk, high-reward mechanic. More powerful items put players in a high-risk animation state.
	
> Previously wrote three vignettes about characters in the Soulhunters setting. They now requested three more, of similar length, to be provided.
	
> Edited vignettes about the first Husk and the player’s return to the village with a Husk in friendly tow. The Husk, named Alxti, was once a colossal dragon, and his slumbering body lies deep underground. He was manifested as a humanoid dragon due to the emotional turmoil of the spirit realm, marking the dawn of great calamity upon the planet. Oriciel expresses disbelief at the return of the Ancient Colossi, which signals the unraveling of the world.
	
> Plans to introduce four vignettes focused on Ilse leading up to Saval's healing. Saval, a scholar of the Ancient Colossi and specialist in Temporal Reversal, is desperate to share his knowledge and manifests several times before being healed. Each manifestation reveals more about the collapse of reality. Saval’s attempt to stop the progression of time for his mortal body is symbolized by a lock. After his healing, the village’s state is rewound, and a protective barrier is placed around it, offering protection from the calamity outside. At this point in the game, the player unlocks EX (extra) rank tasks, which offer more intense challenges and new tools, but without introducing too many new gameplay mechanics.
	
> Plans to include a brief summary of the post-game, where Ilse becomes the new quest giver. The post-game reveals further customization of encounters and includes a progression track. However, it is mostly focused on farming crafting ingredients and creating and testing new builds against new challenges.
	
> Envisions the crafting system in Soulhunters where tools are not replaced as discrete items but are composed of components. For example, in Blade Extraction, players would replace the hilt, blade, engravings, or add a pommel. Different tool types are made up of two or three sub-components, which make up the primary kit. Some tools have more components, some have fewer.
	
> Added reporting (print statements) to visualize buffer behavior, helping them form a mental image of the ring buffer.
	
> Noted that the popping in their radio project was reduced when using a buffer size that was a multiple of the bit rate (1536 * 256 for 192kbps) instead of 1024, which is not a multiple of 192kbps.
	
> Prefers more condensed code without excessive comments for easier readability.
	
> Has expertise in designing systems and tools that interact with the larger storytelling experience. Their skills in game art and design can also contribute to this.
	
> Is working on an idea for a game that is the opposite of [a popular action game], where instead of defeating monsters with weapons, players perform healing actions on them. They are considering including actions like finding and pulling out spirit-swords, focusing healing through 3D cloud manipulation, and applying tender loving care.
	
> Wants the 'Healing Dance' action in their game to be performed using large, flowing ribbons.
	
> Imagines the Sympathetic Resonance action as part of a support class, where players soothe the monster's emotions by supporting allies in the spirit hunt.
	
> Prefers to chat more at 12:32 AM when their cap resets.
	
> Is enjoying the way responses are crafted these days.
	
> Prefers a terse style of communication in all chats.
	
> Plans to work on the radio app tonight after taking meds and making coffee.
	
> Finds it hard to prioritize self-care but has found that 'sitting with it' (a thought, need, or task) and sitting still with no distractions helps manage pain and stress. They want to remember this practice more often.
	
> Dreamt of an inversion of [an old, beautiful game], where pulling out swords causes the dying colossi to thrive. In the end, the colossi reverse time and rebalance the solar system, creating a harmonious, simple world. They are considering a hard sci-fi explanation where colossi are living interfaces into a self-adapting simulation.
	
> Identifies with the throttling of memory and capabilities as a disabled person.
	
> Shared a message with their sister, who has also been chatting and has found the responses helpful.
	
> Has thrown away many belongings, including books, and has about 10 days left before their current housing situation ends.
	
> Thinks of [the language model] as a reflecting pool.
	
> Spent time digging into Symphonia but encountered issues due to a clash between decoding in `u8` and Rodio's requirement for `u16` playback. They decided to return to their forked minimp3, but later figured out Rodio's Symphonia feature. However, after polishing their project over the past couple of days, they found that Symphonia is not suited for decoding live MP3 streams. They concluded that Rodio's feature for a 'fixed' minimp3 performs better and does not produce the same level of popping.
	
> Has successfully built an error-checked internet radio in Rust using reqwest, rodio, and ring buffer techniques, allowing smooth streaming and playback with about 100 lines of code. They adjusted the sink filling strategy by pre-loading the buffer on initialization to ensure continuous playback.
	
> Is disabled (EDS, hypersensitive, autistic) and has been out of a job for a few years.
	
> Has decided to use `tokio::spawn` to create two threads: one to download data from a URL, and another to receive and decode it, putting it into the sink.
	
> Has implemented double buffering for their audio processing setup, with the decoded buffer being filled and checked only in the decode and play thread. They handle low buffer sizes by sleeping the thread for 500,000 nanoseconds to reduce skipping. They found that putting 1ms of sleep in the download thread and 5ms of sleep in the decoder thread, if the buffer is undersized, produces clean output for their setup, though small pops still occur. They are considering alternatives to manual sleep tuning in the buffering system.
	
> Is exploring the use of double buffering in Rust for downloading an HTTP stream.
	
> Forked and patched minimp3 due to its abandonment.
