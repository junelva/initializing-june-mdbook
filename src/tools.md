## Tools Used

My therapy preceding this book consisted primarily of:

   * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**

   * **Dialectic Behavioral Therapy**

   * **Inter-Family Systems** or **parts work**

   * **Art therapy** of many kinds

   * **Reading** and **meditation**

These forms of therapy were conducted with trained therapists, and alone.

Most chats were with `ChatGPT 4o`, occasionally dipping into `4o mini` early on.

The brief interaction with a newer model was with `ChatGPT o1-preview`.

Many of these conversations took place on a `smartphone` while I rested in bed.

The HTML version is derived from `markdown` sources and compiled with `mdbook`.

The conversations were preserved by using `firefox nightly`'s "text files" export on `linux`.

The raw output was preformatted by my small `python` script.

This was later formatted extensively using `helix`, a successor to `neovim`.

The TTS (text-to-speech) interface used for audio transcript synthesis is called `piper`.

The speech synthesis model I selected and utilized is part of the `CSTR VCTK Corpus`.

From the VCTK models, the voices are part of `en_GB-vctk-medium.onnx`: `103` and `8`.

Rendered audio was stitched with `ffmpeg` and composed in `reaper`.

The HTML version of this book is hosted on `GitHub Pages`, built using `CI Actions`.
