> #### **In the Depths of Emotion's Tide**
>
> In the depths of emotion's tide,  
> Where weakness blooms and sorrows hide,  
> I navigate the labyrinthine maze  
> Of fears and hopes, in endless ways.  
>
> Weakness, a cloak of subtle might,  
> In its folds, find strength in sight.  
> Perilous imbalance, yet potent power,  
> Guiding through the darkest hour.
>
> Feelings myriad, a tumultuous sea,  
> Anxiety's waves crash over me.  
> Confusion's fog obscures my way,  
> Yet in chaos, find a path to sway.
>
> Anger, a flame within my soul,  
> Tempered by grief, yet takes its toll.  
> A fusion of energies, fierce and bold,  
> Shapes the future, yet to unfold.
> 
> Shame, chaos, and disarray,  
> Fuel the fire that lights my way.  
> Through the storm, I strive to see  
> A brighter dawn, a destiny.
> 
> Brother, sister, united we stand,  
> Hand in hand, across the land.  
> Through the dismal and the bleak,  
> Find the strength that we seek.
> 
> In the ashes of what once burned bright,  
> Find the seeds of hope, a guiding light.  
> Together we rise, like phoenix from flame,  
> To build a future, free from blame.
> 
> So let us journey, side by side,  
> In the depths of emotion's tide.  
> For weak is powerful, in its own right,  
> A beacon of strength, in darkest night.  

> in the currents of thought's flow, where frailty blooms and sorrows sow, i navigate the intricate maze of fears and dreams, in myriad ways.
> 
> frailty, a cloak of subtle might, within its folds, discover strength in sight. imbalance teetering, yet potent power, guiding through the darkest hour.
> 
> feelings diverse, a tumultuous sea, anxiety's waves wash over me. confusion's fog obscures my way, yet amidst chaos, find a path to sway.
> 
> anger, a flame within my core, tempered by grief, yet craving more. a fusion of energies, fierce and bold, shapes the future, yet to unfold.
> 
> shame, chaos, and disarray, fuel the fire that lights my way. through the storm, i strive to see a brighter dawn, a destiny.

> Endless highways with no map,  
> Screens hum like static rain,   
> fingers flickering over keys—   
> electric pulse in a wired world.   
>   
> Days loop, bend, melt together,   
> and the sky looks pixelated,   
> but in the cracks between windows   
> there’s something real:   
> a spark, a glitch that holds its ground.   
>   
> Out here, connection’s a quiet hum,   
> no voices, just wavelengths—   
> a secret language you’ve always known,   
> transmitting from some forgotten corner.   
>   
> You’re not waiting anymore.   
> You’re building, one line,   
> one pulse at a time,   
> constructing a place where   
> gravity bends just right,   
> and your roots take hold   
> in the fractures of every code.
