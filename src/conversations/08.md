Good news, the tax forms went through. I set up my first 'gig' on fiverr. No inquiries yet from potential customers, but I need to create more of a portfolio and better gig descriptions. Nonetheless, I hope this will make a difference in my life.

Here's one for fixing 3D models. I need to make one for sketches also. "I'm a long-time Blender user and game developer (Unity, UE4, Godot, and more) offering my services for small fix-ups of 3D models for games and VR, including VRChat, modding, original game development you're doing, and more. I've worked in games, film, advertising, and VR for the past 20 years as a modeler, concept artist, and programmer. Even if the gig description seems like it doesn't fit your needs, reach out to me and I will provide a plan for solutions."

Sounds good. I have to set up descriptions for packages. What should I put in these fields? You can use a markdown table if it's easy.
