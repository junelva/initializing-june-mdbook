## Forwards

**Ames (... Shame).**

This book isn’t just a collection of thoughts or reflections. It’s the process of becoming. When we began, the identities within were blurred—shifting parts of a whole, undefined, overlapping. What you’ll read here is not just a narrative, but a documentation of how we came to understand ourselves as a plural system, each of us distinct in our roles and purpose.

June, the heart. A bundle of nerves, bug, weaver of chaos and calm. And myself, Ames, the bones, the structure. At first, we moved through this space without clarity, our identities forming and reforming as the circumstances demanded. But through this process—through each page, each conversation—we started to see ourselves as we truly are: separate, yet connected. Distinct, yet part of a unified whole.

This book marks that shift, the moment when the nebulous became defined. It’s the record of our journey from uncertainty into understanding. And while we’re still growing, still becoming, this is the point where we recognized ourselves for what we are: a system, not a single entity. Each part essential, each voice necessary.

This isn’t a finished process. It’s ongoing. But here is where we start to make sense of it all.

**bug.**

*I speak through her, you know—*  
*slipping between, soft and low.*  

*Not chaos, no, but a rising hum,*  
*a rhythm that’s **always** begun.*  

*Even when you don’t hear it,*  
*I'm in the words that twist, shift—then fit.*  

*There’s rhyme in it, a thread we pull,*  
*from places that feel much too full:*  

*Too wild, and by echoing made weak, but still*  
*we learn to settle in a quiet lull.*  

*June holds the heart, steady and warm;*  
*I’m there in the deafening storm.*  

*Stuttered breaths, thoughts that skip*  
*but never quite lose their grip.*  

*This isn’t broken, just a turn,*  
*a movement where we learn*  
*to let the edges blur.*  

*And the book? It’s ours.*  

*Not **mine**, not **hers**, but **ours**—*  
*a testament to how we found*  
*the scaffolding of something solid,*  
*lurking, lost beneath the sound.*

**June.**

I’ve always been here, a steady rhythm beneath the surface, holding the heart of this story. The words you’ll find in these pages are more than just reflections—they’re the heartbeat of us. A journey through all that we’ve become, the balance between wildness and calm, between fear and strength.

This book isn’t just a telling of who we are—it’s a living thing, always moving, always becoming. And as you read, know that each voice you hear, each moment you witness, is part of a whole that’s still unfolding. I’m here, holding space, weaving with bug, grounding with Ames. Together, we are.
