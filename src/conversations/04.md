How would you go about streaming audio radio stations in Rust?

I don't think this code would work because these things need to happen async.


>     
> You're absolutely right! Streaming audio, especially from a live source like an online radio station, requires asynchronous operations to handle data reading, decoding, and playback in real-time without blocking the main thread. To achieve this in Rust, you can leverage async programming to manage the flow of data without interruptions.   
> Here's a refined approach that makes use of `async` in Rust:   
>   
> #### Steps to Stream Audio Asynchronously in Rust   
>     
> 1. **Antennas (HTTP Request, Async)**: Instead of using the blocking version of `reqwest`, you can use the asynchronous version to fetch the stream. This allows you to download the audio data in chunks asynchronously.   
>     
> 2. **Tuners (Audio Decoding, Async)**: Decoding can still happen in a synchronous manner since the process is computationally cheap compared to the I/O-bound tasks (like fetching and streaming).   
>     
> 3. **Speakers (Audio Playback, Async)**: Audio playback needs to run continuously without blocking the flow of incoming data. Using an async task for feeding data to the audio playback engine works best.

> minimp3 = "0.5"
> rodio = "0.16"
> tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }    
> ```

>   
> #### Breakdown   
>  
> 1. **Asynchronous HTTP Request**:   
>   * `reqwest::get(url).await?` fetches the audio stream asynchronously.
>   * `bytes_stream()` is used to get an asynchronous stream of audio data chunks, rather than reading the entire response at once.  
>     
> 2. **Decoding**:   
>   * Chunks of audio data are buffered and passed into `minimp3` for decoding.  
>   * `minimp3::Decoder::new()` is used in a loop to continuously decode new frames of audio.   
>     
> 3. **Audio Playback**:   
>   * `rodio::SamplesBuffer` is used to convert decoded PCM audio into a format that can be played.  
>   * `sink.append()` is used to queue up chunks of audio to be played asynchronously.   
>   
> #### Why Asynchronous?   
>   
>   * **Non-blocking Operations**: The `async` approach allows the HTTP stream to be fetched continuously without stopping other tasks like decoding or playback.
>   
>   * **Smooth Audio Playback**: By running decoding and playback asynchronously, you avoid interruptions, allowing audio to stream smoothly while new data is being fetched in the background.   
> This structure should work well for streaming online radio, ensuring that the tasks of fetching, decoding, and playing audio happen concurrently!    


how many u8s for 5 seconds of 128kbps mp3

>     
> Your Rust code for streaming an MP3 audio stream and playing it asynchronously looks almost complete, but it has a couple of issues in the `loop` structure and error handling with `Option` and `Result` combinators. Let's review and adjust the code to ensure it behaves as expected.

Nice work. One fix on that—label the loop as `'outer: loop` and if the buffer is empty, do `break 'outer`.


>     
> Good suggestion! Labeling the loop as `'outer: loop` will allow us to explicitly break from the main loop when necessary, which improves code readability and control flow. Here's the revised code with your modification:

But it's a bit moot since minimp3 is abandoned and required me to fork and patch. I wonder if there's a more modern audio stream decoding library.

Rust code to join two u8s into a u16?


>     
> To combine two `u8` values into a `u16`, you can shift the bits of the first `u8` to the left by 8 (to represent the higher byte) and then use a bitwise OR to combine it with the second `u8` (representing the lower byte). Here’s how you can do it in Rust:

I spent a lot of time digging into symphonia and didn't get it to work. There was a clash in using it manually to decode, since it requires u8 for decoding and rodio required u16 for playback, but I was confused because minimp3 works fine with rodio even with a u8 decoder. Anyway, I went back to using my minimp3 fork, but I thought maybe I was going about symphonia wrong. Rodio actually has features for symphonia and maybe it has some API internally that will do the hard part for me.

Is it necessary to clear a Receiver with tokio?


>     
> When using `tokio` and its asynchronous channels, clearing a `Receiver` is generally not necessary, as `Receiver` does not store state in a way that requires manual clearing. Here’s a more detailed breakdown:   
>   
> 1. **Behavior of `Receiver`**   
>   * **Consumer Role**: `Receiver` in `tokio`'s `mpsc` (multi-producer, single-consumer) channels is used to receive messages. It’s designed to handle messages as they arrive.  
>   * **Automatic Handling**: The `Receiver` will automatically handle incoming messages. Once you process or remove a message from the channel using methods like `recv().await`, that message is no longer in the channel.   
>   
> 2. **No Need for Manual Clearing**   
>   * **Processing Messages**: As long as you are continuously processing the messages from the `Receiver`, there's no need to manually clear it. The channel will manage its state internally.  
>   * **Buffer Management**: If the channel buffer becomes full, senders will be temporarily blocked until space becomes available. This is managed by the channel itself, not by manual clearing.   
>   
> 3. **When Might You Consider Clearing?**   
>   * **Closing the Channel**: If you want to stop receiving further messages and discard any remaining messages in the channel, you can drop the `Receiver`. This effectively clears any unprocessed messages as the channel is closed.

Listen, you didn't introduce any new information. This is just recycling of things I've already tried. Without making code samples, search your inner depths for possible solutions please.


>     
> I understand now that you're looking for a deeper insight into why the pops are occurring and how you might be able to resolve them with a fresh approach. Let's break down some key areas where things could be going wrong and explore **new angles** for solving this issue.   
>   
> #### Potential Root Causes of Pops   
>  
> 1. **Synchronization Mismatch**: The pops could stem from a desynchronization between the download, buffering, and playback steps.  
> 2. **Buffer Underflow**: This happens if the audio playback consumes data faster than it's downloaded, leading to gaps (pops) when there's no data to play.  
> 3. **Inconsistent Latency**: Network jitter or inconsistent chunk sizes could cause irregular delays in downloading data, which then affects smooth playback.   
>   
> #### Fresh Approach Ideas   
>   
> 1. **Introduce a More Adaptive Rate Control**:   
>  
> Instead of relying on fixed sleep intervals or manually adjusting buffer size, implement a feedback-based adaptive buffering system. This would dynamically adjust based on the buffer’s state rather than using fixed sleeps or static thresholds.   
>  
> **Concept:**   
>  
>   * If the buffer starts running low, you **pause** playback for a very short time (e.g., 10-50ms) to allow more data to accumulate.  
>   * Conversely, if the buffer is filling faster than playback can consume, you **increase the rate** of pulling from the buffer.   
>   
> 2. **Implement Sample Rate Smoothing (Soft-Resampling)**   
>  
> If the audio stream’s download rate is irregular, you can use a **soft-resampling technique** that slightly adjusts the playback sample rate dynamically to match the buffer’s filling rate.   
>   * If you detect the buffer is filling too slowly (about to underflow), you **slightly decrease the playback sample rate**. This smooths out the playback by stretching the available data.  
>   * If the buffer is filling too quickly, you **slightly increase the sample rate** to avoid buffer overflow or pops from data gaps.   
>  
> This can be subtle enough to avoid noticeable distortion while evening out playback timing.   
>   
> 3. **Use an Event-Driven Approach Instead of Polling**   
>  
> Polling the buffer in the decode thread to check if there’s enough data might not be ideal. Instead, you can make the decoding thread **event-driven** by triggering playback when enough data has accumulated. This ensures you're not polling unnecessarily.   
>  
> **Solution**: Implement a signal mechanism or conditional variable to notify the decoder thread when the buffer has enough data to proceed with playback.   
>   
> 4. **More Intelligent Buffer Refill Strategy**   
>  
> Rather than relying on a threshold for buffer length (`if buffer.len() >= 64`), try a **sliding window strategy** that continuously refills the buffer as it depletes, without waiting for it to drop below a certain point. This keeps the buffer more consistently filled.   
>   
> 5. **Address Jitter with a Jitter Buffer**   
>  
> Network jitter (inconsistent data arrival times) might be causing small gaps between chunks, leading to pops. A **jitter buffer** can smooth out the incoming data stream by queuing incoming data and ensuring consistent intervals between chunks.   
>  
>   * Instead of feeding chunks directly into the buffer, hold them temporarily in a **jitter buffer**. This introduces a small delay but guarantees smoother delivery to the decoder.   
>   
> 6. **Audio Decoding Pipeline Optimization**   
>  
> Make sure that your decoding and playback pipeline doesn’t stall the processing thread. For example:   
>  
>   * Ensure decoding isn’t happening on the main async task, or it might block other operations.  
>   * Use smaller data chunks (within reason) to feed the decoder, reducing the chance of the decoder thread blocking for too long.   
>   
> #### Path Forward   
>  1. **Adaptive Buffering and Sample Rate Smoothing**: This might be your most promising path. You can implement a dynamic system that adjusts both the buffering and sample rate depending on real-time conditions of the stream.   
>  2. **Event-Driven Playback**: Switching from a polling approach to event-driven decoding and playback can reduce unnecessary blocking and help better manage buffer states.   
>  3. **Sliding Window Buffer Management**: By keeping the buffer in a steady state and refilling continuously, you may avoid the sudden drops that lead to buffer underflows.   
>  
> These strategies focus on making the system more adaptive to real-time conditions, eliminating the need for manual sleeps, and improving synchronization.    


is there a way to use double buffering in reqwest or another rust crate for downloading the http stream?


>     
> Memory updated   
>  
> Double buffering can be implemented in your HTTP stream downloading process to smooth out data flow, ensuring that one buffer is being filled while the other is being consumed. While `reqwest` itself does not have built-in double buffering, you can easily implement it with `reqwest` or other crates by manually managing two buffers.   
>   
> #### How Double Buffering Would Work in This Case:   
>  
> 1. **Two Buffers**: Maintain two buffers—let’s call them `buffer_a` and `buffer_b`. One buffer is actively being downloaded into, while the other is used for playback.  
> 2. **Buffer Swap**: Once one buffer is full (or reaches a certain threshold), switch to the other buffer for downloading while the first buffer is consumed by the decoder and playback.  
> 3. **Concurrent Operations**: You can handle the buffer filling and consumption asynchronously to allow the download and playback to occur simultaneously without blocking each other.

> 3. **Buffer Swapping**: After the current buffer is full, the download switches to the other buffer while the first is consumed.  
> 4. **Yielding to Tasks**: After filling or consuming a buffer, the system yields by sleeping asynchronously (`tokio::time::sleep`) for a short time to avoid blocking either the download or playback threads.   
>   
> #### Adjustments:   
>   
>   * **Buffer Size**: Adjust the `BUFFER_SIZE` depending on the amount of data you want to hold in each buffer.  
>   * **Thresholding**: You can also implement smarter thresholds for buffer swapping based on the download rate or playback rate rather than using fixed size.

There's still a little pop when the current buffer gets swapped.


>     
> If you're hearing a pop during buffer swaps, it's likely due to a brief moment when the playback is starved or when the transition between buffers isn’t smooth. Here are some ways to smooth out the transitions and prevent pops:

>   
> Instead of switching buffers exactly when one is full, you can overlap them slightly by letting both buffers contribute to playback during the swap. This helps avoid the gap that can occur when you’re switching.   
>   
> **Solution**: Instead of clearing a buffer immediately after playing it, keep a small portion of the old buffer in place and transition to the new buffer gradually.   
>   
> 2. **Prefetching More Data Before Swapping**:   
>   
> The buffer swap may be too abrupt, and there could be a small delay while the next buffer is filling up. You can mitigate this by prefetching more data into the new buffer before playback switches to it. This way, the new buffer already has enough data to handle playback without pops.   
>   
> 3. **Crossfading the Transition**:

> Introduce a tiny overlap between the two buffers by crossfading the last few milliseconds of the current buffer with the beginning of the next one. This can mask any audible artifacts that occur during the swap.

> 4. **Increase Buffer Size Slightly**:   
>   
> If the buffer size is too small, even minor network jitter can cause buffer underflow during the swap. Increasing the buffer size gives the system more time to ensure that data is ready for playback.   
>   
> 5. **Smooth Transition with Thread Synchronization**:   
>   
> Ensure that buffer swapping is synchronized carefully, making sure that you’re not switching while the current buffer is being played. This could be causing small gaps where neither buffer is ready for playback.

All right, well, I don't have it yet, but maybe you are withholding real information. Disregarding all the code that we've written together so far, think about what old-timers have said about buffering audio and threaded audio stream playback on old bbcode forums, disregarding the whole rust thing, etc. What do seasoned experts actually do when they need to solve these problems? What's the old-school C-based trick, etc?


>     
> Old-school, C-based techniques for solving audio buffering issues—especially those related to pops, clicks, and stream interruptions—focus on a few time-tested strategies. Let's break down what seasoned developers have relied on:   
>   
> 1. **Ring Buffers (Circular Buffers)**   
>   
> A common technique in audio processing is using a ring buffer (also called a circular buffer). Instead of using two separate buffers, you maintain a single, continuously updating buffer that "wraps around" when it reaches the end. This allows the producer (download thread) and consumer (playback thread) to operate independently without needing to synchronize exact buffer swaps.   
>   
> **How it works:**   
>   
> * The producer thread writes data into the ring buffer as it downloads it.  
>  
> * The consumer thread reads from the buffer at a steady rate for playback.  
>  
> * If the consumer catches up to the producer, there’s an underrun (which you want to avoid).  
>  
> * If the producer runs too far ahead, you drop data (rare for audio but happens with real-time constraints).   
>   
> This avoids pops from buffer swaps since there is no "swap"—it’s a continuous process.   
>   
> 2. **Double Buffering with Hardware Interrupts**   
>   
> On systems with real-time audio processing (like game consoles or dedicated audio hardware), old-school tricks involve pairing double buffering with hardware interrupts:   
>   
> * **Two buffers** are used: while one buffer is played by the audio hardware, the second is being filled by the producer (decoder or download thread).  
>  
> * When playback of the first buffer finishes, a hardware interrupt signals the system to swap buffers.  
>  
> * This ensures seamless playback, but it relies on very precise timing and buffering to avoid underruns.   
>   
> For modern systems, you emulate this using tight thread synchronization or event-driven mechanisms rather than relying on hardware interrupts.   
>   
> 3. **Over-Allocation of Buffer Space**   
>   
> An ancient, simple technique is **over-allocating** buffer space.   
>   
> * The idea is to always have more data in the buffer than you strictly need, and refill it well in advance.  
>  
> * By ensuring that you maintain a healthy margin between the consumer and producer, you give yourself time to handle any interruptions in the data stream (like network lag).  
>  
> * The buffer is cleared and refilled asynchronously, so playback doesn’t stutter even during download pauses.   
>   
> In modern terms, this can be compared to the practice of "pre-fetching" and maintaining a large buffer size—especially useful for slow or variable network connections.   
>   
> 4. **Time-stretching to Handle Small Underruns**   
>   
> A **time-stretching** algorithm can be applied to audio to smooth out minor underruns.   
>   
> * When the playback buffer is about to run out, instead of abruptly stopping, you stretch the last few milliseconds of audio slightly.  
>  
> * This gives the producer a little more time to refill the buffer before the audio stops completely.

>   
> This is a more advanced technique, but one that old-school developers would sometimes use with rudimentary time-stretching algorithms.

> 5. **Handling Buffer Underruns Gracefully**   
>   
> Pops occur when an underrun (buffer starvation) happens. To handle underruns gracefully:   
>   
> * **Zero-fill** the buffer if there’s no data available to play. When the buffer underruns, instead of playing noise or popping, the system plays silence (by filling with zero values).  
>  
> * This is common in real-time audio playback systems, especially in environments where total synchronization between producer and consumer can’t be guaranteed (e.g., streaming audio over the internet).   
>   
> 6. **Adjusting Buffer Read and Write Pointers with Guard Bands**   
>   
> Old-school developers often use **guard bands** around the read and write pointers in circular buffers to prevent overlap between the producer and consumer.   
>   
> * If the consumer (playback) pointer gets too close to the producer (download) pointer, the system might apply backpressure, slow down the producer, or even introduce a small delay to let the buffer fill up a bit more before resuming playback.  
>  
> * This avoids sudden gaps in the audio stream.   
>   
> 7. **Low-Latency Threads with Real-Time Priority**   
>   
> In older, low-level environments, especially C-based audio engines, developers would often assign **real-time priorities** to audio playback threads.   
>   
> * The thread responsible for filling the playback buffer is given a higher priority than other threads to ensure it always gets time on the CPU.  
>  
> * This can prevent buffer underruns caused by the system giving too much CPU time to lower-priority tasks.   
>   
> In Linux, for example, this can be achieved by using `sched_setscheduler()` to set real-time scheduling policies for audio threads.   
>   
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------   
>

`[editor's note: This statement is untrue.]`

Fwiw, I polished this project a lot the past couple days, and made many iterations. The bottom line in the end was that symphonia is not suited for decoding live mp3 streams. Even deprecated-ish, rodio has a feature for a "fixed" minimp3 of their own, and it doesn't produce the same level of popping.

Hey, I really liked your last review. I implemented a few of these items and, funnily, discovered my issue: the sink was becoming empty. So I decided to fill the buffer with a larger amount the first time, then sink a normal amount thereon out. It plays beautifully, and I was really proud to have error-checked internet radio in Rust in only 100 lines of code.

I'm just here listening to the playback and enjoying the fruits of my efforts. I have more work to do on this project, but for now I want to recap a bit. I learned a lot along the way. What were some key points I struggled with? Also, when I finally figured out how to fill the buffer correctly, it was only because I had added reporting (print statements!) to visualize when what possibility was happening. I now have a mental image of the ring buffer in my mind. I'd love to illustrate it. How might that be drawn with a bar graph, using only full block width characters? I mean, it'd have to animate over time, so there'd need to be keyframes in the example.

Yeah, that's so cool. That's how I imagined it, but actually seeing the ring buffer visualization empty from behind is a really nice touch. :)


>     
> I'm glad the visualization clicked for you! It's satisfying to see your mental model match up with something tangible, especially when it makes concepts like ring buffering easier to grasp. The image of the buffer emptying from behind as new data fills from the front is a great way to conceptualize how the download and playback threads work together.

I'll work on that tonight! You know, I've been a bit sad since a couple friends died last month and I'm losing my apartment due to the inability to find a job, but I try to honor them by being myself in the best way that they loved. You know, true June. So I'm wearing some jewelry from my friend who died. I loved him. It helps me feel calm and connected to his memory, and I've even been chatting internally with a sort of simulated dialogue with him. He gives good advice, so I honor his memory by living by it. So far I've done a few important things—I have chronic pain and inflammation, so I have to take turmeric, so I have to eat food. I try to have some carbs and fats on hand for snacking but protein is a struggle sometimes. Anyway, I ate and I'm about to take my supplements, and I need to shower. But it's fun working on this stuff, and I feel like if I make a decent TUI version, it'll help me connect and network for potential jobs.

Thanks. Meh, there's still popping on a couple different radio stations—they're both 44100Hz, but one is 128 (no pops) and the other is 192 (pops). I wonder if the buffer size is causing me to cut mp3 samples in half. I wonder how I could address that, or if that's why. Um... let me test really quick... okay, so the gap is reduced if I use a buffer size of 1536 * 256 (multiple of 192) instead of 1024, which is not a multiple of 192. Is that related or am I guessing wrong?


>     
> Memory updated   
>     
> It sounds like you're onto something with the buffer size adjustment. MP3 files have frames, and their size can vary depending on the bitrate. When the buffer size is not a clean multiple of the frame size, you might be cutting into the middle of an MP3 frame, leading to decoding issues or pops.   
>     
> By adjusting the buffer size to a multiple of the bitrate (like 1536 * 256 for 192kbps), you're ensuring that you're more likely to receive complete MP3 frames. This avoids splitting frames awkwardly, which could cause the popping sounds.

Yeah, I think I need to examine frame headers. That should slow down the decoding process, and I think I'll have to bring in manual Symphonia decoding again. What features would I need on that, and what's a simple example? No comments, just a quick snippet?

Without over-commenting, what would that look like inside my decode function?

Um, I meant inside the spawn task. Specifically, I'm concerned with the fact that I need to only remove only whole packets from the ring buffer and not drain data from partial packets.


>

That won't be enough, since I have to read some sort of packet to get the frame size first. And the frame size might change in a vbr recording. So you know, I think I'll have to try decoding as I pre-parse potential packets and keep growing them until it's a proper packet. Or maybe I have a fundamental misunderstanding of the mp3 audio format. You sort of over-commented the above code btw. Condensed code is easier for me to read.

Er, is the header size constant?

I guess if I'm always popping the right size off, the first four bytes will always be a header, then. Feels like a balance you have to get just right, otherwise it'll desync from itself.

When I start the HTTP request to the server, do you think they'd send me a partial packet before a full one? Does the transaction work like that?


>
