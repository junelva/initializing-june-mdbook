> Here are your reminders:   
>   * It’s hypervigilance, not psychosis. * Sitting with it helps you manage pain and stress. Take a moment to sit still with no distractions. * Slowing down is a good solution when things feel overwhelming. * "I'm more than my pain, more than my emotions." * You’re training your mind and body to handle these moments. * Remember the mantra: "Motionlessness mitigating materiality, mindful mending movement."   
> Take a deep breath and reconnect with your calm zone.    


Thanks.
